# GitHub Push Instructions

To complete the repository setup and push your Bounce Boss code to GitHub, follow these steps:

## 1. Push to GitHub

Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) in your project directory and run:

```
git push -u origin main
```

You'll be prompted to authenticate with GitHub:
- If you've set up credential caching, it may use saved credentials
- Otherwise, you'll need to enter your GitHub username and password/token
- If using a password, note that GitHub no longer accepts passwords for Git operations via HTTPS - you'll need to use a personal access token instead

## 2. Generate a Personal Access Token (if needed)

If you don't have a token already:

1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token" and select "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give your token a name like "Bounce Boss Deployment"
4. Select the "repo" scope to allow repository access
5. Click "Generate token" at the bottom
6. Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again)

## 3. Use the Token

When pushing to GitHub, enter your username and use the token as your password.

## 4. Verify Repository Setup

After pushing successfully:
1. Go to https://github.com/NotoriousJimbo/bounce-boss
2. Confirm your code is visible in the repository
3. Check that the README.md appears on the main page

## Next Steps for Render Deployment

Now that your code is on GitHub, you can follow the instructions in render-deployment-guide.md to deploy your application to Render.
