# BOUNCE BOSS - Implementation Order

This document outlines the recommended sequence for implementing the tasks defined in `next_tasks.md`. The order is based on dependencies, priorities, and logical workflow.

## Critical Path (Phase 1)

These tasks form the core functionality needed for a working booking system:

1. **Task 1: Supabase Bookings Table Setup** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: None
   - This is foundational - all other database operations depend on having the schema properly defined
   - Completed on: 3/22/2025

2. **Task 2: Booking Model & Data Layer**
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Creates the interface between the application and database

3. **Task 3: Booking API Endpoints** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Connects the frontend to the database through RESTful API endpoints
   - Completed on: 3/22/2025

4. **Task 4: Terms & Conditions Implementation** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: None (can be worked on in parallel with Tasks 1-3)
   - Required for legal compliance before accepting bookings
   - Completed on: 3/22/2025

5. **Task 5: Payment UX Improvements**
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: None (can be worked on in parallel with Tasks 1-4)
   - Ensures a smooth payment experience for customers

## Secondary Features (Phase 2)

These enhance the core functionality with important integrations:

6. **Task 7: Email Notification System**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: Tasks 1-3
   - Provides essential communication with customers

7. **Task 9: Admin Authentication**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: None (can be worked on in parallel)
   - Secures admin functionality

8. **Task 6: Booking Form Enhancement**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: Tasks 1-3
   - Improves user experience for the booking process

9. **Task 8: Google Calendar Integration**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: Tasks 1-3
   - Helps with availability management

## Admin & Reporting (Phase 3)

These build out the administrative capabilities:

10. **Task 10: Admin Dashboard - Bookings List**
    - Priority: Medium
    - Dependencies: Tasks 7, 9
    - Provides booking management interface

11. **Task 11: Admin Dashboard - Booking Details**
    - Priority: Medium
    - Dependencies: Task 10
    - Adds detailed booking management

## Technical Improvements (Phase 4)

These enhance overall system quality:

12. **Task 12: Error Handling & Logging** ✅ COMPLETED
    - Priority: Medium
    - Dependencies: None (can be implemented at any stage)
    - Improves system robustness
    - Completed on: 3/23/2025

13. **Task 13: Mobile Optimization** ✅ COMPLETED
    - Priority: Medium-Low
    - Dependencies: Core functionality complete
    - Enhances mobile user experience
    - Completed on: 3/23/2025

14. **Task 14: Performance Optimization**
    - Priority: Low
    - Dependencies: All core functionality
    - Polishes overall system performance

## Parallel Development Strategy

To maximize development efficiency, work can be organized into parallel tracks:

### Track 1: Backend & Database
- Task 1: Supabase Bookings Table Setup
- Task 2: Booking Model & Data Layer
- Task 3: Booking API Endpoints

### Track 2: Frontend & User Experience
- Task 4: Terms & Conditions Implementation
- Task 5: Payment UX Improvements
- Task 6: Booking Form Enhancement

### Track 3: Integrations
- Task 7: Email Notification System
- Task 8: Google Calendar Integration

### Track 4: Admin & Management
- Task 9: Admin Authentication
- Task 10: Admin Dashboard - Bookings List
- Task 11: Admin Dashboard - Booking Details

## Recommended First Steps

1. Start with Task 1 (Database Schema) to establish the foundation
2. While database work is underway, begin Task 4 (Terms & Conditions) in parallel
3. Once schema is defined, move to Task 2 (Data Layer) and Task 5 (Payment UX) simultaneously
4. After data layer is established, implement Task 3 (API Endpoints)
5. With functioning backend, implement Task 7 (Email Notifications)

This approach establishes core functionality first while allowing parallel development on independent components.
